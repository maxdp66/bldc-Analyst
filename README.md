# bldc Analyst
Brushless motor analyst for small electrical vehicles
Analyst to monitor performance of bldc motor and battery pack. As well as to gather 
performance data to analyze autonomy and range in various situations.
This repository is not yet finished and needs to be ported to an ESP32 as I am running
out of memory on the Arduino Nano.

I tried adding as much comments in the code as possible to make it easier for you to understand what's going on.

The following hardware is used to perform the analysis:
   - Arduino Nano
   - D54 IR obstruction avoidance sensor, to be replaced with the hall sensor output
   - ST7735 full color SPI display 128 x 160, to be replaced with a 160 x 320 screen
   - ACS724 Â± 50A current sensor
   - ADS1115 I2C voltage sensor
   - DS18B20 one wire temp sensor for battery
   - Piezo buzzer 5V for alarms
   - White LED to show motor is TURNING
   - DS1302 RTC module to keep track of time

>[!WARNING]
># TODO:
>- Switch to HALL pulses instead of IR avoidance sensor D54
>- Swap Arduino Nano for ESP32 board
>- Ditch the DS1302 RTC and get a DS3132, DS1302 has too much drift
>- Incorporate data logging
>- Set timestamps for data collection
>- Add GPS tracking and geo fencing
>- Make code compatible with 2.4" tft screen
